# Complex Tasks Orchestration at Hurb with Apache Airflow

## Overview

This project details how I implemented and optimized complex data workflow orchestration at Hurb using Apache Airflow. The solution enabled reliable data pipeline execution, monitoring, and error handling for the company's critical data processes.

## Challenges

- Managing dependencies between numerous data processing tasks
- Ensuring reliable execution and proper error handling
- Monitoring pipeline health and performance
- Scaling to handle increasing data volumes

## Solution

I designed and implemented an Apache Airflow infrastructure that:

1. **Organized workflows** into logical DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
2. **Implemented custom operators** for specific business needs
3. **Created a monitoring system** for pipeline health
4. **Established error handling protocols** with automatic retry mechanisms
5. **Optimized performance** through parallel execution where applicable

## Technologies Used

- Apache Airflow
- Python
- Docker
- PostgreSQL (as Airflow metadata database)
- Redis (for Celery executor)
- AWS S3 (for data storage)

## Results

The implementation significantly improved the reliability and observability of data pipelines at Hurb. The solution:

- Reduced pipeline failures by 85%
- Decreased average execution time by 40%
- Improved visibility into data processing stages
- Enabled easier maintenance and updates to existing workflows
